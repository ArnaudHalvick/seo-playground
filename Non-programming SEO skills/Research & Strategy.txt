Research & Strategy (Non-Programming SEO)
Core purpose
Build an evidence-based plan that aligns business goals with searcher demand. Convert raw market/keyword signals into intent-led clusters, a content roadmap, and prioritized bets with measurable outcomes.
Key skills
* Market & audience discovery (ICPs = Ideal Customer Profiles, JTBD = Jobs To Be Done, pains/gains, seasonality, VoC = Voice of Customer mining)
* Keyword research & clustering (intent modeling, semantic grouping, mapping one primary KW = keyword per URL = Uniform Resource Locator)
* SERP = Search Engine Results Page & intent analysis (feature inventory, content patterning, freshness, entities)
* Topical authority planning (hub ? spoke architecture, scope, internal-link blueprint)
* Competitor intelligence (SERP competitors, gap/overlap, playbooks)
* Prioritization & forecasting (impact/effort models, traffic potential, business value)
* Measurement scaffolding (cluster-level KPIs = Key Performance Indicators, dashboards, decision cadence)
Outcomes & deliverables
* Audience dossier: ICPs (Ideal Customer Profiles), buying stages, repeated pains/objections, language bank.
* Keyword universe: deduped list grouped into clusters with intent labels and priority.
* SERP playbook per cluster: result types, feature targets (snippet/PAA = People Also Ask/video/local), content pattern.
* Topical map: hubs, spokes, supporting angles; ownership; internal linking plan (editorial layer).
* Roadmap: 6–12 week plan with scores (impact × confidence ÷ effort; ICE = Impact, Confidence, Effort), owners, and milestones.
* Brief templates: reusable content brief + snippet-capture checklist.
* Measurement plan: KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) by cluster, dashboards, review cadence, refresh criteria.
Workflow (high level)
1. Discover (market, audience, VoC = Voice of Customer) ?
2. Harvest & cluster (keywords, intents) ?
3. Model SERPs (features, format, bar to beat) ?
4. Design topical map (hubs/spokes, scope) ?
5. Size & prioritize (ICE/RICE; RICE = Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort + value) ?
6. Brief & schedule (governance) ?
7. Measure & iterate (by cluster).
1) Market & Audience Discovery
Inputs
* Sales/support calls, win/loss notes, tickets, reviews, forums (Reddit, G2, niche communities).
* Seasonality and buying cycle insights; competitor positioning and pricing.
Actions
* Define ICPs (Ideal Customer Profiles) and JTBD (Jobs To Be Done): what are they trying to accomplish and why now?
* Extract a language bank: exact phrases for pains, desired outcomes, evaluation criteria.
* Map buying stages: problem aware ? solution aware ? vendor aware ? ready to buy.
Outputs
* 3–5 ICP (Ideal Customer Profile) one-pagers; stage-by-stage questions; top 10 repeated objections; glossary of user terms.
Quick checks
* Can you name the five most repeated pains and the three evaluation criteria your ICPs use?
* Do you know which month/trigger most often initiates research?
2) Keyword Research & Clustering
Inputs
* Seeds (site search, competitor top pages, PPC = Pay-Per-Click terms, existing content), SERP features, autosuggest, “People Also Ask.”
Actions
* Expand with modifiers: who/what/how/near-me/price/best vs vs/alternatives/problems/setup/errors.
* Classify intent: informational, commercial investigation, transactional, navigational.
* Cluster semantically: one parent topic per hub; 4–10 spokes that solve sub-tasks or angles.
* Map one primary KW (keyword) per URL (Uniform Resource Locator) to prevent cannibalization; supporting KWs roll up to the same page.
* Score each keyword: estimated volume × clickability (SERP CTR = Search Engine Results Page Click-Through Rate) × business value ÷ difficulty.
Outputs
* A deduped keyword universe with: primary KW (keyword), intent, cluster, stage, priority, target URL (new/existing), notes.
Quality bar
* Each URL has exactly one primary KW and a small set of supporting variants.
* Long-tail “how to / template / checklist / alternatives” live as spokes—not separate hubs.
3) SERP & Intent Modeling
Inputs
* Live SERPs for cluster head terms and key spokes (desktop + mobile).
Actions
* Inventory result types: comprehensive guides, listicles, PLPs = Product Listing Pages, comparison pages, tools/calculators, videos, news, local.
* Note features: featured snippet, PAA (People Also Ask), image pack, video, local pack, sitelinks, reviews, freshness dates.
* Reverse-engineer content patterns: average length, structure, tables, images/charts, examples, external citations.
* Identify entity expectations: products, brands, locations, attributes repeatedly mentioned.
* Decide snippet capture opportunities: definitional paragraph, Q&A blocks, numbered steps.
Outputs
* Cluster playbook: recommended page format, essential sections, proof elements, snippet targets, freshness expectation.
Quick checks
* Does your planned format match what Google already rewards for the same intent?
* What unique value will you add (original data, calculator, benchmark, teardown, visuals)?
4) Topical Authority Planning
Actions
* Draw a hub ? spoke map: hub = definitive guide / category lens; spokes = sub-tasks, comparisons, tools, FAQs = Frequently Asked Questions.
* Ensure every spoke links up to its hub and across to sibling spokes where helpful (editorial layer).
* Define scope boundaries: what belongs to this hub vs. a neighboring hub to avoid overlap.
* Plan adjacent entities and FAQs to cover breadth (glossary, pitfalls, alternatives, costs, timelines).
Outputs
* Visual topical map, page list with owners, editorial internal-link plan, and “done when” definition per hub.
Pitfall to avoid
* Spawning multiple “near-duplicate” spokes that split equity. Consolidate when intent is the same.
5) Competitor Intelligence (SERP-first)
Actions
* Identify SERP (Search Engine Results Page) competitors for each cluster (often different from business competitors).
* Compare winners on: topic coverage, structure, media, proof (quotes, data), E-E-A-T = Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness signals, link profile.
* Choose one of three plays per cluster: outdo (10× value), angle-shift (new POV = Point of View/format), or avoid (not worth it).
Outputs
* Cluster-level competitive grid, “bar to beat” notes, and a differentiation statement per planned page.
Quick checks
* Can you articulate in one sentence why your page will deserve the click over the current #1?
6) Prioritization & Forecasting
Scoring model (simple & effective)
* Impact (traffic + revenue potential), Confidence (evidence strength), Effort (people time).
* ICE score = (Impact × Confidence) ÷ Effort. Rank across clusters and spokes.
Traffic sizing (directional)
* Use head term volume × expected CTR = Click-Through Rate from the actual SERP × realistic rank band (e.g., #3–#5).
* Add long-tail uplift from spokes (rule-of-thumb 20–40% if coverage is strong).
Outputs
* 6–12 week roadmap with ICE (Impact, Confidence, Effort) scores, owners, week-by-week deliverables, and draft/publish dates.
Notes
* Re-score monthly. Promote items that show momentum or where competition rises.
7) Content Brief Template (reusable)
* Header: Cluster, page type (hub/spoke/comparison/tool), owner, due dates.
* Goal: Primary intent + business outcome (lead, trial, consultation, sale).
* Primary KW: One. Supporting KWs: 5–12 grouped by sub-section.
* Search intent: What the user expects to accomplish in one visit.
* SERP summary: Result types, features to target, “bar to beat,” gap you’ll fill.
* Outline: H2/H3 = Heading level 2/Heading level 3 skeleton aligned to intent (answer fast; add proof, examples, visuals).
* Proof & E-E-A-T: Data points, quotes, screenshots, case studies, author credentials, sources.
* Differentiation: What makes this definitively better (original research, calculator, teardown, pricing clarity).
* Internal links: Must-link hub, sibling spokes, related tools/pages; anchor suggestions (natural language).
* Conversion: Primary/secondary CTAs = Calls To Action, trust builders (testimonials, awards, policies).
* Snippet capture: One-paragraph definition, Q&A, steps, table candidates.
* Maintenance: Freshness trigger (feature releases, regulation changes, quarterly review).
8) Governance & Ops (tie-ins)
Roles
* DRI = Directly Responsible Individual per cluster, editor, SME = Subject Matter Expert/author, SEO reviewer, publisher.
* RACI = Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed for each page.
Workflow
* Brief ? SME draft ? SEO review ? edit ? legal/brand check (if needed) ? publish ? annotate ? measure ? refresh.
Cadence
* Weekly standup (progress/roadblocks), monthly review (wins, misses, reprioritization), quarterly strategy update.
9) Measurement Plan (by cluster)
Leading indicators
* Publication velocity vs. plan, coverage completeness (hub + # of spokes live), feature presence (snippet/PAA).
Lagging indicators
* Impressions, clicks, CTR (Click-Through Rate), average position for cluster (not just page), conversions/assists.
Diagnostics
* Cannibalization (multiple URLs ranking for same primary), content decay, intent mismatch (high impressions, low CTR).
Review rhythm
* 14 days post-publish: sanity check (indexing, early impressions).
* 30–45 days: first optimization pass (titles/metas, intro clarity, internal links).
* Quarterly: refresh/consolidate, expand spokes where gaps remain.
10) QA Checklists
Pre-publish (content)
* Primary KW present in title/H1/intro naturally; intent satisfied within first screenful.
* Clear differentiation added (data, examples, tool, visuals).
* Internal links to hub + 2–3 spokes; descriptive anchors.
* Snippet-capture blocks (definition, steps, Q&A) included where relevant.
* Author bio/last updated/source citations present.
Post-publish (2 weeks)
* Indexed? Ranking URL correct (no duplicates)? Internal links live? Feature eligibility (snippet/PAA) visible?
11) Common pitfalls to avoid
* Treating volume as the goal; intent fit and business value come first.
* Multiple pages chasing the same primary keyword; consolidate instead.
* Ignoring SERP format requirements; writing essays when SERP rewards checklists/tools.
* “Me-too” content with no proof or differentiation.
* No ownership or refresh plan; clusters stall after first publish.
How to use this guide
* Kick off each new market/segment with Discovery ? Cluster ? SERP model ? Topical map ? Prioritize.
* Maintain a single source-of-truth sheet that ties clusters ? briefs ? roadmap ? metrics.
* Review by cluster, not page, to catch cannibalization and plan refreshes with leverage.
