1) Link Acquisition & Digital PR
Goals
Earn editorially placed, relevant links and brand mentions that real people would click—no junk directories or paid link schemes.
Linkable asset types
* Data studies: proprietary usage data or curated industry stats with charts (make “quote-worthy” nuggets).
* Tools & templates: calculators, checklists, planners, audit templates.
* Definitive guides: genuinely comprehensive, with original examples and visuals.
* Local resources: curated lists/maps, event calendars, compliance guides.
Outreach targets
* Journalists/bloggers (beats that match your asset), niche publications, newsletters
* Partners/suppliers, universities/associations, resource pages, community sites, podcasts
Pitch anatomy
* Hook (why now: seasonality, regulation change, trend)
* One insight (contrarian or surprising stat)
* Why you (methodology, sample size, expertise)
* Easy pickup (pull-quotes, charts, embed options)
* Follow-ups (fresh angles for different beats)
Quality bar
* Relevance to the page you need to strengthen (cluster alignment)
* Natural, branded or partial-match anchors (no keyword stuffing)
* Placement on pages that get real traffic and are editorially curated
Sustainable habits
* Quarterly asset ? outreach cycle; weekly micro-pitches for timely opportunities
* Maintain a CRM/spreadsheet: contact, angle pitched, status, links earned, follow-up date
2) Local SEO (non-dev operations)
Google Business Profile (GBP) essentials
* Primary & secondary categories, services, business description with value props
* NAP (Name-Address-Phone) consistency across major citations; track changes
* Photos/videos (authentic, recent, georelevant), Products/Services entries, FAQ = Frequently Asked Questions
* Weekly posts (offers, events, updates), messaging (if staffed), hours (including holidays)
Location pages (editorial side)
* Unique local proof (team photos, storefront/interior, maps/directions, parking, transit)
* Local testimonials/case studies + community involvement (sponsorships, events)
* Local FAQs (neighborhood specifics, regulations, delivery/coverage)
* Internal links from relevant articles to location pages with natural anchors
Citations & directories
* Prioritize quality/industry/local sites; fix inconsistencies; avoid mass low-quality submissions
3) Reviews & UGC Governance
Collection system
* Identify “happy moments” for the ask (delivery confirmation, milestone, support resolution)
* Use concise, mobile-friendly request flows; rotate platforms to diversify (GBP, industry sites)
* Incentivize ethically (e.g., draw for feedback, not for 5-star ratings)
Response policy
* Respond to all reviews; acknowledge positives, resolve negatives publicly then move to private
* For issues: apologize ? diagnose ? offer next step; sign with a human name + role
* Escalate recurring themes to product/support; close the loop
Reuse & insight mining
* Surface reviews on key pages (snippets, carousels), with permission when required
* Mine UGC for language (objections, benefits) to improve copy, FAQs, and briefs
4) Image & Video SEO (workflow, no code)
Strategy
* Choose topics where visuals help users accomplish the job faster and where SERP shows image/video features.
Video checklist
* Titles that mirror searcher phrasing; clear value promise up front
* Descriptions with summary, time-stamped chapters (00:00 intro, 01:12 step 1, etc.)
* On-screen text that reinforces key steps; end-screen with next video/CTA = Call To Action
* Publish on your channel and embed on the most relevant page (add short textual summary for context)
Image checklist
* Purposeful visuals: steps, comparisons, before/after, diagrams
* Descriptive filenames and captions that add meaning for users (avoid keyword spam)
* Place near the relevant section; reference in copy to increase engagement
Thumbnails
* Telegraph the answer/benefit; clear subject; minimal text; face or focal object when relevant
5) E-E-A-T Amplification
Visible expertise
* Real bylines with bios/credentials; link to profiles (speaker pages, publications)
* Methodology boxes for rankings/reviews; cite reputable sources
Third-party proof
* Press/awards logos, certifications, client logos (with permission)
* Case studies with outcomes and screenshots; quotes from recognized experts
Consistency
* Align claims and positioning across your site, GBP, social profiles, and outreach materials


QA = Quality Assurance checklists
Pre-launch (asset/outreach)
* Asset is genuinely cite-worthy (data/tool/original angle)
* One-page media brief: hooks, pull-quotes, charts/screens, methodology
* Target list segmented by beat; first-line personalization written
* Tracking sheet ready (status, links, anchor, target page, cluster)
Local SEO
* GBP fully filled (categories, services, hours, photos, FAQs, posts)
* NAP matches across top citations; no duplicate listings
* Location pages include local proof, unique copy, internal links
Reviews & UGC
* Ask triggers configured; response templates approved
* Response SLA (Service Level Agreement): ?48h public response for negatives
* Quarterly review mining session scheduled (insights ? briefs/copy)
Media (image/video)
* Titles promise specific value; thumbnails are legible and on-brand
* Video chapters present; embed placed near matching section with textual summary
* Captions/callouts add clarity; sources credited when applicable
Common pitfalls to avoid
* Chasing quantity of links over quality/relevance
* Generic mass outreach; no angle, no personalization
* Thin “location pages” with copy-paste content and stock photos
* Review asks only once (no timing/trigger logic) and no public responses
* Videos with vague titles/thumbnails; embeds without surrounding context
* Making bold claims without sources, authors, or visible expertise


Measurement (off-page focus)
Link & mention impact
* New referring domains tied to clusters; anchor diversity; pages strengthened (target URLs)
* Assisted metrics: uplift in impressions/positions/CTR (Click-Through Rate) for target pages
Local
* GBP actions (calls, direction requests, website clicks), photo views vs. peers
* Local rankings directionally (avoid obsessing over pin-point ranks), conversions per location page
Reviews & UGC
* Review velocity, average rating, response time SLA, sentiment themes
* UGC reuse rate (quotes/screens used in pages or ads)
Media
* Video retention and click-through from thumbnails; page engagement after video views
* Image-led traffic to sections; time on page where visuals are added
How to operationalize this quarter
* Pick one cluster that needs authority ? plan a single linkable asset with two PR angles
* Build a 30-contact targeted list; send 1st-line-personalized pitches in two waves
* Fully optimize one high-impact GBP + refresh photos + add 3 local FAQs
* Launch a review ask at one “happy moment” and set a 48h response SLA
* Produce one short explainer video with chapters and embed it on the matching page
* Add an E-E-A-T proof strip (press logos, awards, author bio) to your top two money pages
