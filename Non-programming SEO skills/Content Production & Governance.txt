Content Production & Governance (Non-Programming SEO)
Core purpose
Build a reliable, repeatable editorial machine that turns research and strategy into high-quality pages—on time, on brief, and aligned with business outcomes. Standardize how ideas become drafts, drafts become published pages, and pages are measured, refreshed, or retired.
Key skills
* Editorial planning: cluster-based calendars, quarterly themes, SLA = Service Level Agreement timing, capacity planning.
* Governance & workflows: clear roles (DRI = Directly Responsible Individual; RACI = Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed), hand-offs, approvals.
* Style & voice operations: unified tone (TOV = Tone of Voice), formatting, sourcing, claims standards.
* Localization & international ops: true localization (not just translation), cultural fit, compliance.
* E-E-A-T operations: E-E-A-T = Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness; author sourcing and review loops.
* Compliance & accessibility: GDPR = General Data Protection Regulation, privacy, WCAG = Web Content Accessibility Guidelines basics, no PII = Personally Identifiable Information leaks.
* Quality assurance: pre-publish and post-publish QA = Quality Assurance, retro and refresh cadence.
Outcomes & deliverables
* Quarterly content roadmap tied to clusters, with owners, SLAs, and dependencies.
* Source-of-truth brief template and SOP = Standard Operating Procedure for “brief ? draft ? review ? publish ? refresh.”
* Editorial style guide (TOV, structure, claims, linking, citation).
* Localization playbook (market research, terminology, examples, pricing/units).
* E-E-A-T pack (author bios, credentials, review policy, sourcing standards).
* QA checklists (pre-publish, 14–45 day optimization, quarterly refresh).
* Measurement framework with KPI = Key Performance Indicator targets and review cadence.
Workflow (high level)
1. Intake & prioritization (from cluster roadmap)
2. Briefing (approved outline, proof/evidence plan, internal link targets)
3. Drafting (Subject Matter Expert SME or writer)
4. SEO review & edit (intent fit, SERP alignment, internal links)
5. Legal/brand checks (if needed)
6. Publish & annotate (notes, owners, review date)
7. Measure & optimize (14–45 day pass)
8. Refresh/retire (quarterly)
1) Editorial planning
Inputs
* Cluster priorities from strategy, capacity per role, seasonal moments, product/feature launches.
Actions
* Create a rolling 12-week calendar by cluster and funnel stage.
* Assign DRI per page; set SLA for each step (briefing, draft, review, publish).
* Track dependencies (design, data pulls, customer quotes, subject-matter interviews).
* Reserve buffer for refreshes (10–25% of monthly capacity).
Outputs
* Calendar (owner, status, due dates), risk log, and weekly standup agenda.
Quick checks
* Does every planned page tie to a cluster and have a single, accountable owner?
* Is at least one refresh scheduled for each high-value hub this quarter?
2) Governance & workflows
Roles
* DRI (Directly Responsible Individual): accountable for delivery end-to-end.
* SME (Subject Matter Expert): provides facts, screenshots, examples, quotes.
* Editor: ensures structure, clarity, and adherence to style and brief.
* SEO reviewer: validates intent fit, SERP = Search Engine Results Page alignment, internal links, snippet opportunities.
* Legal/brand approver: optional gate for sensitive topics.
* Publisher: final formatter/uploader (can be the DRI in small teams).
RACI (Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, Informed)
* Define per template (e.g., guides, comparisons, local pages). Keep it visible in your tracker.
Handoffs
* Each step requires a definition of done (e.g., draft must include sources, image list, internal-link anchors).
3) Editorial style & voice system
Tone of Voice (TOV)
* Pick 3–5 traits (e.g., Clear, Practical, Evidence-led, Friendly). Include do/don’t examples.
Structure standards
* Intros: state the user’s job and outcome within 3 sentences.
* Subheads: descriptive H2/H3; bullets for steps/criteria; summary box when useful.
* Claims: cite at least one reputable source for any statistic or regulation.
Linking & sourcing
* Internal links: hub ? in intro or outro; 2–4 sibling ? links contextually.
* External links: cite sources that improve trust (standards bodies, primary research).
* Anchors: natural language; avoid keyword stuffing.
4) Localization & international operations
Scope
* True localization (examples, idioms, regulations, pricing, units) vs. literal translation.
Actions
* Build a market glossary (terms, metaphors to use/avoid).
* Localize titles/metas and CTAs (CTA = Call To Action) to local idiom and promise.
* Validate legal/regulatory references with local SMEs.
* Maintain semantic parity across locales (same core entities/topics) while adapting angle and proof.
Quality bar
* A local reader should feel it was written for them, not translated at them.
5) E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) operations
Author program
* Real bylines with bios and credentials; link to professional profiles where appropriate.
* Capture experience: screenshots, failure stories, before/after, proprietary data.
Review policy
* For YMYL (Your Money or Your Life) or sensitive pages, add SME review and re-review cadence.
Transparency
* Last-updated date and change notes for significant edits; methodology boxes for rankings/comparisons.
6) Compliance & accessibility
Privacy & data
* Avoid PII (Personally Identifiable Information) in screenshots; blur/redact.
* Respect GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) for EU audiences; align with your cookie and consent policy.
Accessibility
* Follow WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) basics: clear headings, alt text for meaningful images, descriptive link text, adequate contrast.
* Readability target: short sentences, plain language for complex concepts.
Claims & legal
* For regulated topics, cite official sources; include disclaimers where required.
7) Content quality framework
Definition of done (per page)
* Intent matched; unique value added (data, examples, tool, template, benchmark).
* E-E-A-T visible (author, sources, last updated).
* Internal links implemented (hub + siblings), anchors reviewed.
* Snippet-capture blocks present where relevant (definition, Q&A, steps/table).
* Clear, testable CTA.
Peer review rubric (score 1–5)
1. Intent fit
2. Structure & clarity
3. Proof/E-E-A-T
4. Differentiation
5. Conversion readiness
8) Templates & documentation
* Brief template (from Part 1) attached as a mandatory intake.
* Outline template with section starters for each common page type (guide, comparison, checklist).
* Evidence pack: how to request customer quotes, data pulls, or screenshots.
* Localization checklist: terminology, compliance, pricing/units, date formats.
* Publishing checklist: links, images, alt text, metadata, categories/tags in your CMS = Content Management System.
9) Measurement & cadences
KPI (Key Performance Indicator) tiers
* Leading: pages shipped vs. plan; hubs with ?5 spokes; presence in featured snippet/PAA = People Also Ask.
* Lagging: impressions, CTR = Click-Through Rate, average position, assisted conversions.
* Quality diagnostics: scroll depth, time on page, cannibalization cases, update velocity.
Review rhythm
* Weekly: progress standup, blockers, scope changes.
* Monthly: performance review by cluster (not page), identify refreshes/consolidations.
* Quarterly: strategy retro; reset goals and capacity.
Goal framework (optional)
* OKR = Objectives and Key Results per cluster (e.g., “Establish topical authority in ‘X’—ship 1 hub + 8 spokes; achieve snippet share of 30%”).
10) Refresh & retirement policy
Refresh triggers
* Traffic/rank decay vs. last 90–180 days; intent drift in SERP; outdated facts/screenshots; thin proof.
Actions
* Re-title/meta for clarity; strengthen intro; add missing sections or examples; update internal links.
* Mark material changes in “last updated” notes.
Retire/consolidate
* If two pages target the same primary intent, merge into the stronger one and update anchors across the cluster.
11) QA (Quality Assurance) checklists
Pre-publish
* Title/H1 reflect the user job; intro delivers outcome quickly.
* Outline covers current SERP bar and adds differentiation.
* E-E-A-T elements present; compliant sources cited.
* Hub ? + 2–4 sibling ? links; anchors descriptive.
* Alt text written; sensitive data redacted; CTAs placed.
14–45 day optimization
* Early CTR (Click-Through Rate): consider title/meta tests.
* Fill proof gaps; add missing examples/tutorial visuals.
* Inject internal links from high-traffic pages.
Quarterly refresh
* Re-evaluate intent and SERP features; consolidate overlaps; schedule next review.
Common pitfalls to avoid
* Shipping content with no DRI or dates—things stall.
* Over-approvals that add delay without improving quality.
* “Me-too” drafts that lack proof or a fresh angle.
* Treating localization as translation—no local proof, idioms, or pricing.
* Ignoring accessibility—unlabeled images, generic link text (“click here”).
How to operationalize this tomorrow
* Appoint a DRI for each active cluster and backfill the RACI.
* Move every in-flight idea into the standard brief template before drafting.
* Stand up a weekly 25-minute editorial review (wins, stuck items, next week).
* Reserve 20% of capacity for refreshes and consolidation—protect it like a budget.
* Build your first QA and localization checklists into the CMS as required fields.
