# Complete SEO Services - Technical + Strategic

**Full-Stack Developer + SEO Strategist | Bridging Code and Search**

Most SEO specialists can only do half the job—either they understand strategy but can't implement technical solutions, or they can code but lack SEO expertise. I do both. This platform demonstrates every service I offer through working code and actionable frameworks.

## Problems I Solve

### 🚫 "Our site has XXX pages but Google only indexes a few"

**The Problem:** E-commerce filter combinations create infinite URL variations, wasting crawl budget and causing duplicate content penalties.

**My Solution:** Smart parameter classification + robots.txt patterns + dynamic canonicalization that prevents URL explosions while keeping valuable facets indexable.

**See It Working:** `/technical-seo/parameters` + `/shop` interactive demo

**What You Get:** Production-ready code or technical specifications for your dev team, handling edge cases that scale to millions of URLs.

---

### 📉 "Organic traffic dropped 30% and we don't know why"

**The Problem:** No diagnostic framework to identify whether the issue is content decay, keyword cannibalization, technical errors, or algorithm updates.

**My Solution:** Systematic measurement frameworks with KPI dashboards organized by cluster and funnel stage, plus diagnostic checklists for rapid troubleshooting.

**See It Working:** `/strategic-seo/measurement-optimization`

**What You Get:** Custom diagnostic framework adapted to your business, with actionable next steps and priority ranking.

---

### 💸 "We spend a lot of money on content but rankings haven't moved"

**The Problem:** Content production without keyword clustering, search intent modeling, or topical authority strategy. Publishing volume without strategic direction.

**My Solution:** Research-to-execution frameworks that convert keyword data into intent-led clusters, then translate clusters into hub & spoke content architecture.

**See It Working:** `/strategic-seo/research-strategy` + `/strategic-seo/content-architecture`

**What You Get:** Complete keyword cluster strategy with content briefs, internal linking plan, and editorial calendar.

## Try the Live Demo

Visit the `/shop` section to test real-world SEO scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Safe to Index**

- Pagination: `/shop/t-shirts?page=2` → `index,follow`, self-canonical (not to page 1)
- Clean path route: `/shop/t-shirts/for/women/` → `index,follow`, semantic URL structure

**Scenario 2: Smart Noindex Decisions**

- Filter variants: `/shop/t-shirts?color=black` → `noindex,follow`, canonical to clean base path
- Unstable parameters: `/shop/t-shirts?color=black&sort=price_desc` → `noindex,follow`, canonical drops params to base

**Scenario 3: Crawl Trap Prevention**

- Multi-select: `/shop/t-shirts?color=black,blue,red` → Blocked via robots.txt pattern
- Prevents 2^N URL explosion (2^3 = 8 combinations in this example)

**The SEO Receipt** updates in real-time as you apply filters, showing the exact reasoning behind each decision—just like production SEO systems should work.

## Technical Deep-Dive Highlights

**Parameter Classification:** Stable parameters (color, size, gender) can be indexed with query params OR converted to clean paths. Unstable parameters (sort, view, page) trigger noindex. Blocked parameters (utm\_\*, sessionid) are blocked in robots.txt.

**Multi-Select Detection:** Comma-separated values (`?color=black,blue,red`) create 2^N URLs and are automatically blocked before they waste crawl budget.

**Canonical Strategy:** Dynamic decisions based on URL structure—clean paths get self-canonical + index, single stable params keep parameter + index, multiple params get noindex, unstable params get dropped, multi-select gets blocked.

**Framework-Agnostic Logic:** SEO decision engine (`/lib/rules/`) is decoupled from Next.js, making it portable to any tech stack.

**Full Documentation:** See `/docs` for complete architecture, decision flow diagrams, and extension guides.
