## Why This Exists

I built this project to:

1. **Master advanced SEO** through hands-on implementation
2. **Show potential clients** what comprehensive SEO expertise looks like in practice
3. **Bridge strategy and code** - demonstrating both what should be done and how to do it

This isn't a real e-commerce store. It's an educational workshop where every feature solves real-world SEO challenges, from crawl budget optimization to content architecture planning.

## Featured: The SEO Receipt

Every technical page includes a real-time panel showing URL transformation, indexability decisions, meta robots tags, robots.txt status, sitemap inclusion, crawl trap risk analysis, and clean path recommendations. The SEO Receipt demonstrates exactly how production SEO systems make decisions, showing working query parameter URLs while providing educational recommendations for clean path migrations as best practice.

## Interactive Demo Highlights

Visit `/shop` to test these scenarios:

### ✅ Safe to Index

- **Single stable filter:** `/shop/t-shirts?color=black`  
  → `index,follow`, canonical keeps parameter

- **Clean path routes:** `/shop/t-shirts/for/women/`  
  → `index,follow`, semantic URL structure

### ⚠️ Noindex, Follow

- **Unstable parameters:** `/shop/t-shirts?color=black&sort=price_desc`  
  → `noindex,follow`, canonical drops sort parameter

- **Pagination:** `/shop/t-shirts?page=2`  
  → `noindex,follow`, self-canonical (not to page 1)

### 🚫 Blocked in Robots.txt

- **Multi-select (2^N crawl trap):** `/shop/t-shirts?color=black,blue,red`  
  → Blocked via `Disallow: /*?*color=*,*`  
  → Prevents 2^3 = 8 URL combinations

The SEO Receipt updates in real-time as you apply filters, showing you the exact reasoning behind each decision.

## Key Technical Patterns

**Parameter Classification:** Stable parameters (color, size, gender) can be indexed with query params OR converted to clean paths. Unstable parameters (sort, view, page) get dropped and pages get noindex. Blocked parameters (utm\_\*, sessionid) are blocked in robots.txt.

**Multi-Select Detection:** Comma-separated values (`?color=black,blue,red`) create 2^N URLs and are automatically blocked. Single values are safe to index.

**Canonical Strategy:** Clean URLs (e.g., `/for/women/`) → self-canonical + index,follow. Single stable param (e.g., `?color=blue`) → keep param + index,follow. Multiple stable params → noindex,follow. Any unstable → drop and noindex. Multi-select → robots.txt block.

**Sitemap Strategy:** Dynamic generation with educational best practices:

- Automatically generated from catalog data (all categories, colors, sizes, genders)
- Clean path gender facets (e.g., `/shop/t-shirts/for/women/`) - always included (fully implemented)
- Single-param URLs for ALL colors and sizes (e.g., `/shop/t-shirts?color=black`, `/shop/shoes?size=9`) - included to demonstrate query param approach
- SEO Receipt provides educational recommendations for converting param URLs to clean paths (e.g., `/shop/t-shirts/color/black/`)
- Clean path recommendations show best practice without creating duplicate content (not implemented as routes)
- Multiple params excluded to avoid combinatorial explosion (N×M combinations)
